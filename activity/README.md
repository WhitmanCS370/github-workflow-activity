# GitHub Workflow Activity

## Learning goal

The purpose of this activity is to gain experience with the GitHub workflow with IntelliJ IDEA CE, including handling pull requests and merge conflicts.

## Instructions

1. Assign the role of _maintainer_ to one of your group members. They should use this **[GitHub Classroom invitation](https://classroom.github.com/a/sJDhmJqf)** to create a new team and repository for this activity. The other team members should join. 
    - **Do not** change the repository settings on GitHub. The roles of _maintainer_ and _contributor_ should be assigned informally amongst the members of your group.

1. Each group member should:

    - Run IntelliJ IDEA CE;
    - Clone the repository for today's assignment;
    - Configure the project;
    - Run it;
    - Open [this shared Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nmXnHzB3lVCibH7GBOUqPDiIjG7x67VOqJcoT3seRwQ/edit?usp=sharing) and record any notes you have on the process so far. _In particular, please record the time at which you finish this step._
    - If you need help, don't hesitate to ask!

1. Assign the role of _contributor_ to the other two group members. Your team's goal is to have the _contributors_ work together to replace the placeholder text with a food you both enjoy. Follow the __Contribution Workflow__ to accomplish this goal. _Maintainer_, when asked to review the PR, accept and merge the PR.

1. Take a moment and reflect on your experience in the previous step. Record in your shared notes any insights you have learned or any questions that you still have. __Get confirmation from Prof Davis before continuing.__

1. Assign the role of _maintainer_ to another group member. The other group members are now _contributors_. Again, they will work together to add some foods they both enjoy, following the __Contribution Workflow__.  ___BUT THIS TIME___, _maintainer_, when asked to review the PR, request an alteration (e.g., "no lettuce please"). Once the change is made, then accept and merge the PR.

1. Assign the role of _maintainer_ to the third group member and repeat the previous step.

1. Take a moment and reflect on your experiences in the previous steps. Record in your shared notes any insights you have learned or any questions that you still have. __Get confirmation from Prof Davis before continuing.__

1. Again, everyone plays the roles of a _contributor_ and a _maintainer_, but never serves as a _maintainer_ for their own PR. This time you will try to force a conflict so that you can experience resolving a conflict in the context of the __Contribution Workflow__. Complete the three tasks below in parallel. Note that only the first PR should merge successfully. The others should require resolving conflicts. Tasks:
    * Add several more favorite foods to the end of the list.
    * Sort the foods in alphabetical order.
    * Group the foods into categories preceded by category headers in ALL CAPS.

1. Take a moment and reflect on your experience in the previous step. Record in your shared editor any insights you have learned or any questions that you still have.
